# Simple Convolution Network
Data taken from [minst](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) of Tensorflow, which is a set of handwriting numbers.

Convolution Network is incredibly accurate with this dataset, even with the basice two-layers model.

The result easily gets to more than 90% accuracy with just 20 rounds of batches of data.
